Bull elephant tracking data for STAT5020

As part of a statistical capstone project, our group partnered with the UGA center for geospatial research and Connected Conservation researchers in Zimbabwe.  Given geographical tracking data for ~15 elephants, primarily bull elephants, the goal of the project was to gain insight into bull elephant behavior and movement.  During adolescence, male elephants are kicked out of their mother herds and will spend many of the following years trecking across the land eating up everything they can find until they are large enough to begin a herd of their own.  During this lonely time, bull elephants tend to act more irrationally, even sometimes going into human settlements in search of food.  Due to this increased level of risk in human-bull interaction, we wanted to be able to better predict this kind of elephant encroachment, specifically around the city of Victoria Falls which is one of the major settlements in the Horn of Zimbabwe where the elephants were located.  This involved feature engineering various potential predictors from the gps data we had, including number of bulls nearby, distance to Victoria Falls, distance to the relevant portion of the Zambezi River, age, and julian day as a proxy for temperature. Using these, both a generalized linear model as well as a neural network were built to predict whether elephants were likely to be in Victoria Falls on the following day.
